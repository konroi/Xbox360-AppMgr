# Xbox360-AppMgr
I was really baked when I came up with / wrote this. But it's runtime safe and very useful for a clean codebase :)

--------------------------------

An Application / Process Mananger for the Xbox 360.
This is not kernel version dependant.

Easy one definition and construct install.

Simply grab a process by it's virtual address space (any address) or it's modules name and gain a 'pInstance', which holds many functions and cached data of the instance in case it is to be unloaded..

Figure it out...
